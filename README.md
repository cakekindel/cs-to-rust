# C# to Rust
learn Rust by transforming C# into Rust, step by step

This is a thought piece that is meant to be read top-to-bottom in order,
and is a "what if" exercise, changing the core values of C# to those of
Rust, with the end goal of arriving at the Rust language.

## Why this guide exists
As someone who was at one point only comfortable
in languages and ecosystems heavily geared towards OOP,

programming language that can have a very steep learning curve.

Hopefully, contextualizing it by experimenting with **language
values** and arriving at Rust will help others grok the Rust language.
